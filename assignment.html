<p>Scene- <i>The Kitchen of the Bishop's cottage. It is plain but comfortably furnished.
On the mantelpiece are two very
very handsome candlesticks, which look strangely out of place with their surroundings.<br>
(Marie is stirring some soup on the fire. Persome laying the cloth, etc.)</i></p></font>
<hr>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Marie, isn't the soup boiling yet? </font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Not yet, Madam.</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Well, it ought to be. You haven't tended the
fire properly, child</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>But Madam, you yourself made the fire
up.</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Don't answer me back like that. It is rude.
</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Yes, Madam. </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Then don't let me have to rebuke you
again.</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>No, Madam. </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>I wonder where my brother can be <i>(looking at
the clock)</i>. It is after eleven o'clock and no sign of him. Marie!</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Yes, Madam.</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Did Monseigneur the Bishop have any
message for me?</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>No, Madam.</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Did he tell you where he was
going?</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Yes, Madam.</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b><i>(Imitating)</i> "Yes, Madam". Then why haven't
you told me, stupid!</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Madam didn't ask me.</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>But that is no reason for your not telling me, is
it?</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Madam said only this morning I was not to
chatter, so I thought-</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Ah, mon Dieu, you thought! Ah! It is hopeless.
</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Yes, Madam. </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Don't keep saying "Yes, Madam" like a parrot,
nincompoop.</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>No, Madam.</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Well, where did Monseigneur say he was
going? </font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>To my mother's, Madam. </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>To your mother's, indeed! And why, pray
?</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Monseigneur asked me how she was and I told
him she was feeling poorly.</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>You told him she was feeling poorly, did you?
And so my brother is to be kept out of his bed, and go without his supper, because you told
him she was feeling poorly. There's gratitude for you!</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Madam, the soup is boiling!</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Then pour it out, fool, and don't chatter. <i>(Marie
about to do so)</i>. No, no, not like that. Here, let me do it, and do you put the salt cellars on the
table-the silver ones. </font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>The silver ones, madam? </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Yes, the silver ones. Are you deaf as well as
stupid? </font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>They are sold, Madam. </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Sold! <i>(With horror)</i> Sold! Are you mad? Who
sold them? Why were they sold? </font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Monseigneur the Bishop told me this afternoon
while you were out to take to Monsieur Gervais, who has often admired them, and sell them
for as much as I could. </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>But you have no right to do so without asking
me.</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b><i>(With awe)</i> But, Madam, Monseigneur the
Bishop told me. </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Monseigneur the Bishop is a - ahem! but - but
what can he have wanted with the money? </font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Pardon, Madam, but I think it was for Mere
Gringoire. </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Mere Gringoire indeed! Mere Gringoire! What,
the old witch who lives at the top of the hill, and who says she is bedridden because she is
too lazy to do any work? And what did Mere Gringoire want with the money,
pray?</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Madam, it was for the rent. The bailiff would not
wait any longer and threat-ened to turn her out today if it were not paid, so she sent little
Jean to Monseigneur to ask for help, and-</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Oh, mon Dieu! It is hopeless, hopeless. We
shall have nothing left. His estate is sold, his savings have gone. His furniture, everything.
Were it not for my little dot we should starve! And now my beautiful, beautiful <i>(sobs)</i> salt
cellars. Ah it is much, too much <i>(she breaks down crying.)</i> </font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Madam, I am sorry. If I had known-</font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Sorry, and why, pray? If Monseigneur the
Bishop chooses to sell his salt cellars he may do so, I suppose. Go and wash your hands,
they are disgrace-fully dirty. </font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Yes, Madam <i>(going towards room)</i>. </font>
<br>
<center><font color="black"><i>(Enter the
    Bishop)</i></center></font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Ah! how nice and warm it is in here. It is worth
going out in the cold for the sake of the comfort of coming in.<i>(Persome had hastened to help
him off with his coat, etc. Marie has dropped a deep courtesy.)</i> </font><br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Thank you, dear. <i>(Looking at her.)</i> Why what is
the matter? You have been crying. Has Marie been troublesome, eh? <i>(Shaking his finger at
her.)</i> Ah! </font><br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>No, it wasn't Marie - but-but-</font><br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Well, well, you shall tell me presently. Marie,
my child, run home now, your mother is better. I have prayed with her, and the doctor has
been. Run home ! <i>(Marie putting on cloak and going.)</i> And Marie, let yourself in quietly in
case your mother is asleep.</font><br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Oh, thanks, thanks, Monseigneur. <i>(She goes to
door, as it opens the snow drives in.)</i></font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Here, Marie, take my comforter, it will keep you
warm. It is very cold tonight. </font>
<br>
<font color="#c79b5f"><b>&nbsp Marie :</b>Oh no, Monseigneur!<i>(shamefacedly)</i>.</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>What nonsense, brother; she is young, she
won't get hurt. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Ah, Persome, you have not been out, you don't
know how cold it has be-come. Here, Marie let me put it on for you <i>(does so)</i>. There! Run
along, little one.</font>
<br>
<br>
<center>
    <font color="black"><i>(Exit Marie.)</i></font>
</center>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Brother, I have no patience with you. There,
sit down and take your soup, it has been waiting over so long. And if it is spoilt, it serves you
right.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>It smells delicious.</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>I'm sure Marie's mother is not so ill that you
need have stayed out on such a naba night as this. I believe those people pretend to be ill
just to have the Bishop call on them. They have no thought of the Bishop!</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>It is kind of them to want to see me.</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Well, for my part, I believe that charity begins
at home.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>And so you make me this delicious soup. You
are very good to me, sister. </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Good to you, yes! I should think so. I should
like to know where you would be without me to look after you. The dupe of every idle scamp
or lying old woman in the parish.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>If people lie to me they are poorer, not I.
</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>But it is ridiculous; you will soon have nothing
left if you give away everything. everything !!!</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>My dear, there is so much suffering in the
world, and I can do so little (sighs), so very little. </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Suffering, yes; but you never think of the
suffering you cause to those who love you best, the suffering you cause to me.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(Rising). You, sister dear. Have I hurt you? Ah,
I remember you had been crying. Was it my fault ? I didn't mean to hurt you. I am sorry.
</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Sorry, yes! Sorry won't mend it. Humph! Oh,
do go on eating your soup before it gets cold.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Very well, dear (sits). But tell me -</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>You are like a child, I can't trust you out of my
sight. No sooner is my back turned than you get that little minx Marie to sell the silver salt
cellars.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Ah, yes, the salt cellars. It is a pity. You - you
were proud of them!</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Proud of them! Why, they have been in our
family for years. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Yes, it is a pity. They were beautiful; but still,
dear, one can eat salt out of china just as well.</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Yes, or meat off the floor, I suppose. Oh, it's
coming to that. And as for that old wretch, Mere Gringoire, I wonder she had the audacity to
send here again. The last time I saw her I gave her such a talking to that it ought to have had
some effect.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Yes! I offe#f58142 to take her in here for a day or
two but she seemed to think it might distress you. </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Distress me!!</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>And the bailiff, who is a very just man, would
not wait longer for the rent, so - so you see I had to pay it.</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>You had to pay it. (Gesture of comic
despair.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Yes, and you see I had no money, so I had to
dispose of the salt cellars. It was fortunate I had them. Wasn't it? (smiling). But I'm sorry I
have grieved you.</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Oh, go on! go on! You are incorrigible. You'll
sell your candlesticks next.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(With real concern) No, no, sister, not my
candlesticks. </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Oh, why not? They would pay somebody's
rent I suppose.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Ah, you are good, sister, to think of that but-I
don't want to sell them. You see, dear, my mother gave them to me on -on her death-bed just
after you were born and-and she asked me to keep them in remembrance of her, sol would
like them, but perhaps it is a sin to set such store by them? </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Brother, brother, you will break my heart (with
tears in her voice). There! don't say anything more. Kiss me and give me your blessings: I
am going to bed. (They kiss.) <br>(Bishop makes the sign of the cross and murmurs a
blessing. Persome locks cupboard door and goes R.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Don't sit up too long and tire your eyes.
</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>No, dear! Good-night! (Persome exits R)
</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(Comes to table and opens a book, then looks
up at the candlesticks.)<br>They would pay somebody's rent. It was kind of her to think of
that.<br>(He stirs the fire, trims the lamp, arranges some books and paper, sits down, is
restless, shivers slightly; clock outside strikes twelve and he settles to read. Music during
this. Enter the Convict s#ba0000thily; he has a long knife and seizes the Bishop from behind.)
</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>If you call out you are a dead man!</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>But, my friend, as you see, I am reading. Why
should I call out ? Can I help you in any way?</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>(Hoarsely) I want food. I'm starving. I haven't
eaten anything for three days. Give me food quickly, curse you.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(Eagerly) But certainly, my son, you shall have
food. I will ask my sister for the keys of the cupboard (Rising). </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Sit down !!! (The Bishop sits smiling). None of
that, my friend! I'm too old a bird to be caught with chaff. You would ask your sister for the
keys, would you? A likely story! you would rouse the house too. Eh? Ha! A good joke truly.
Come, where is the food ? I want no keys. I have a wolf inside me tearing at my entrails,
tearing me; quick, tell me where the food is. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(Aside) I wish Persome would not lock the
cupboard. (Aloud). Come, my friend, you have nothing to fear. My sister and I are alone
here.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>How do I know that? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Why, I have just told you.<br>(Convict looks
long at the Bishop.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Hump! I'll risk it. (Bishop, going to door R.) But
mind! Play me false, and as sure as there are devils in ***** I'll drive my knife through your
heart. I have nothing to lose. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>You have your soul to lose, my son; it is of
more value than my heart. (At door R. Calling.) Persome; Persome.<br>(The Convict stands
behind him with his knife ready.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>(Within.) Yes brother.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Here is a poor traveller who is hungry. If you
are not undressed will you come and open the cupboard and I will give him some
supper?</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>(Within.) What, at this time of night? A pretty
business truly. Are we to have no sleep now, but to be at the beck and call of every ne'er
do-well who happens to pass? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>But, Persome, the traveller is hungry. </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Oh, very well, I am coming. (Persome enters
R. She sees the knife in the Convict's hand-Frightened). Brother, what is he doing with that
knife? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>The knife-oh, well, you see, dear, perhaps he
may have thought I-I had sold ours. (Laughs gently.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Brother, I am frightened. He glares at us like a
wild beast (Aside to him).</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Hurry, I tell you. Give me food or I'II stick my
knife in you both and help myself. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Give me the keys, Persome (She gives them
to him). And now, dear, you may go to bed.<br>(Persome going. The Convict springs in front
of her.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Stop! Neither of you leave this room till I
do.<br>(She looks at the Bishop.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Persome, will you favour this gentlemen with
your company at supper? He evidently desires it.</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Very well, brother.<br>(She sits down at table
staring at the two.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Here is some cold pie and a bottle of wine and
some bread. </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Put them on the table, and stand below it so
that I can see you.(Bishop does so, and opens drawer in table. Taking out knife and fork and
looking at the knife in Convict's hand.) My knife is sharp. (He runs his finger along the edge
and looks at them meaningly.) We don't use forks in prison</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Prison?</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>(Cutting off an enormous slice, which he tears
with his fingers like an animal. Then starts.) What was that? (He looks at the door). Why the
devil do you leave the window unshutte#f58142 and the door unbar#f58142 so that any one can come
in? (Shutting them.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>That is why they are left open. </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Well, they are shut now!</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(Sighs.) For the first time in thirty years.
<br>(Convict eats voraciously and throws a bone on the floor.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Oh, my nice clean floor ! <br>(Bishop picks up
the bone and puts it on the plate.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>You're not afraid of thieves ? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>I am sorry for them.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Sorry for them, Ha! [Drinks from bottle.] That's
a good one. Sorry for them. Ha! ha! ha! [Drinks.] [Suddenly] What the devil are you? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>I am a Bishop. </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Ha!ha!ha! A Bishop. Holy Virgin, a Bishop.
Well, I'm dammed!</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>I hope you escape that, my son. Persome, you
may leave us; this gentleman will excuse you.</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Leave you with -</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Please! My friend and I can talk more freely
then.<br>(By this time, owing to starving condition, the wine has affected him.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>What's that? Leave us, yes, leave us.
Good-night. I want to talk to the Bishop. The Bishop! Ha! ha ! <br>(Laughs as he drinks, and
coughs.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Goodnight, Persome. <br>(He holds the door
open and she goes R. holding in her skirts as she passes the Convict.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>(Chuckling to himself). The Bishop. Ha! Ha!
Well, I'm - (Suddenly very loudly.) D' you know what I am? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>I think one who has suffe#f58142 much.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Suffe#f58142? (Puzzled.) Suffe#f58142? My God, yes,
(Drinks.) But that's a long time ago. Ha! Ha! That was when I was a man. Now I'm not a
man; now I'm a number: number 15729, and I've lived in ***** for ten years.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Tell me about it - about *****.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Why? (Suspiciously.) Do you want to tell the
police-to set them on my tract? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>No! I will not tell the police.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>(Looks at him earnestly.) I believe you
(Scratching his head), but damn me if I know why. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Laying his hand on the convict's arms.) Tell me
about the time-the time before you went to - *****. </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>It's so long I forget; but I had a little cottage,
there were vines growing on it. (Dreamily.) They looked pretty with the evening sun on them,
and - there was a woman-she was (thinking hard)- she must have been my wife-yes was
(Suddenly and very rapidly). Yes, I remember. She was ill, we had no food, I could get no
work, it was a bad year, and my wife, my Jeanette, was ill. dying (pause), so I stole to buy
her food. (Long pause, the Bishop gently pats his hand.) They caught me. I pleaded to them,
I told them why I stole, but they laughed at me and I was sentenced to ten years in the
prison hulks (Pause), ten years in *****. The night I was sentenced the gaoler told me - told
me Jeanette was dead. (Sobs with fury.) Ah, damn them, damn them. God curse them all.
(He sinks on the table sobbing.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>me Jeanette was dead. (Sobs with fury.) Ah,
damn them, damn them. God curse them all. (He sinks on the table sobbing.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Tell you about it? Look here, I was a man once.
I'm a beast now, and they made me what I am. They chained me up like a wild animal, they
lashed me like a hound. I was fed on filth, I was cove#f58142 with vermin, I slept on boards, and I
complained. Then they lashed me again. For ten years, ten years. Oh God! They took away
my name, they took away my soul, and they gave me a devil in its place, but one day they
were careless, one day they forgot to chain up their wild beast, and he escaped. He was
free. That was six weeks ago. I was free, free to starve. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>To starve? </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Yes, to starve. They fed you in *****, but when
you escape from it you starve. They were hunting me everywhere, and I had no passport, no
name. So I stole again. I stole these rags. I stole my food daily. I slept in the woods, in barns,
anywhere. I dare not ask for work, I dare not go into a town to beg, so I stole, and they have
made me what I am, they have made me a thief. God curse them all.<br>(Empties the bottle
and throws it into the fireplace R. smashing it.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>My son, you have suffe#f58142 much, but there is
hope for all.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Hope! Hope! Ha! ha! Ha!<br>(Laughs wildly.)

<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>You have walked far, you are ti#f58142. Lie down
and sleep on the couch there and I will get you some coverings. </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>And if any one comes? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>No one will come; but if they do, are you not
my friend?</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Your friend? (Puzzled.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>They will not molest the Bishop's friend.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>The Bishop's friend.<br>(Scratching his head,
utterly puzzled.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>I will get the coverings.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>The Bishop's friend.<br>(Looks after him,
scratches his head.). The Bishop's friend! (He goes to the fire to warm himself and notices
the candlesticks. He looks round to see if he is alone, and takes them down, weighing them.)
Silver, by God, and heavy. What a prize!<br>(He hears the Bishop coming, and in his haste
drops one candlestick on the table.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(Sees what is going on, but goes to the settle
up L, with coverings.) Ah, you are admiring my candlesticks. I am proud of them. They were
a gift from my mother/A little too handsome for this poor cottage perhaps, but all I have to
remind me of her. Your bed is ready. Will you lie down now? </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Yes, yes, I'II lie down now (Puzzled). Look
here, why the devil are you - Ki - kind to me? (Suspiciously.)What do you want? Eh? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>I want you to have a good sleep, my
friend.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>I believe you want to convert me; save my soul,
don't you call it? Well, it's no good-see? I don't want any damned religion, and as for the
Church - Bah! I hate the Church.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>That is pity, my son, as the Church does not
hate you. </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>You are going to try to convert me. Oh! Ha! ha!
That's a good idea. Ha! ha! No, no, monseigneur the Bishop, I don't want any of your Faith,
Hope, and Charity - see? So anything you do for me you're doing to the devil-under-stand?
(Defiantly.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>One must do a great deal for the devil in order
to do a little for God. </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>(Angrily.) I don't want any damned religion. I tell
you.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Won't you lie down now? It is late!</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>(Grumbling.) Well, all right; but I won't be
preached at, I-I- (On couch). You're sure no one will come?</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>I don't think they will; but if they do - you
yourself have locked the door.</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Humph! I wonder if it's safe? (He goes to the
door and tries it. Then turns and sees the Bishop holding the covering; annoyed.) Here! You
go to bed. I'II cover myself. (The Bishop hesitates.) Go on. I tell you. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Good-night, my son. <br>(Convict waits till he
is off, then tries the Bishop's door.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>No lock, of course. Curse it. (Looks round and
sees the candlesticks again.) Humph! I'II have another look at them. (He takes them and
toys with them.) Worth hund#f58142s, I'II warrant. If I had these turned into money they'd start me
fair. Humph! The old boy's fond of them too, said his mother gave him them. His mother, yes.
They didn't think of my mother when they sent me to *****. He was kind to me too-but what's
Bishop for except to be kind to you? Here, cheer up, my heart, you're getting soft. God!
Wouldn't my chain-mates laugh to see 15729 hesitating about collaring the plunder because
he felt good. Good! Ha! Ha! Oh, my God! Good! Ha! Ha! 15729 getting soft. That's a good
one. Ha! Ha! No, I'II take his candlesticks and go. If I stay here he'll preach at me in the
morning and I'll get soft. Damn him and his preaching too. Here goes!<br>(He takes the
candlesticks, stows them in his coat, and cautiously exits L.C. As he does so, the door
slams.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>(Without.) Who's there? Who's there, I say?
Am I to get no sleep to-night? Who's there, I say? (Enter R. Persome.) I'm sure I heard the
door shut.(Looking round.) No one here? (Knocks at the Bishop's door L. sees the
candlesticks have gone.) The candlesticks, the candlesticks. They are gone. Brother,
brother, come out. Fire, murder, thieves!<br>(Enter Bishop, L.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>What is it, dear, what is it? What is the
matter?</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>He has gone. The man with the hungry eyes
has gone and he has taken your candlesticks. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Not my candlesticks, sister, surely not those?
(He looks and sighs.) Ah, that is hard, very hard. I, I - He might have left me those. They
were all I had (Almost breaking down.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Well, but go and inform the police. He can't
have gone far. They will soon catch him and you'll get the candlesticks again. You don't
deserve them, though, leaving about with a man like that in the house. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>You are right, Persome. It was my fault. I led
him into temptation indeed! </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>The man is a thief, a common scoundrelly
thief. I knew it the moment I saw him. Go and inform the police or I will. (Going; but he stops
her.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>And have him sent back to prison, (Very softly)
sent back to ***** ! No, Persome. It is a just punishment for me; I set too great store by them.
It was a sin. My punishment is just; but oh, God, it is very hard. (He buries his head in his
hand.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>No brother, you are wrong. If you won't tell the
police, I will. I will not stand by and see you robbed. I know you are my brother and my
Bishop, and the best man in all France; but you are a fool, I tell you, a child and I will not
have your goodness abused. I shall go and inform the police.(Going.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Stop, Persome. The candlesticks were mine;
they are his now. It is better so. He has more need of them than I. My mother would have
wished it so had she been here. </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>But (Great knocking without.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#00008B"><b>&nbsp Sergeant :</b>(Without.) Mongseigneur, Monseigneur,
we have something for you. May we enter? </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Enter, my son. <br>(Enter Sergeant and three
Gendarmes with Convict bound. The sergeant carries the candlesticks.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Ah, so they have caught you, villain, have
they? </font>
<br>
<font color="#00008B"><b>&nbsp Sergeant :</b>Yes, Madam, we found this scoundrel
slinking along the road; and as he wouldn't give any account of himself we arrested him on
suspicion. Holy Virgin, isn't he strong and didn't he struggle? While we were securing him
these candlesticks fell out of his pockets. <br>(Persome seizes them, goes to table, and
brushes them with her apron lovingly.) <br>I remembe#f58142 the candlesticks of Monseigneur
the Bishop, so we brought him here so that you might identify them, and then we'll lock him
up. <br>(The Bishop and the Convict have been looking at each other - the Con-vict with
dogged defiance.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>But - but I don't understand; this gentleman is
my very good friend. </font>
<br>
<font color="#00008B"><b>&nbsp Sergeant :</b>Your friend, Monseigneur !! Holy Virgin!
Well!!! </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Yes, my friend. He did me the honour to sup
with me to-night, and I - I have given him the candlesticks. </font>
<br>
<font color="#00008B"><b>&nbsp Sergeant :</b>(Inc#f58142ulously) You gave him-him your
candlesticks? Holy Virgin! </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(Severely): Remember, my son, that she is
holy. </font>
<br>
<font color="#00008B"><b>&nbsp Sergeant :</b>(Saluting) Pardon, Monseigneur.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>And now I think you may let your prisoner go.
</font>
<br>
<font color="#00008B"><b>&nbsp Sergeant :</b>But he won't show me his papers; he
won't tell me who he is. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>I have told you he is my friend. </font>
<br>
<font color="#00008B"><b>&nbsp Sergeant :</b>Well, but-</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Surely? (A pause.)<br>(The Sergeant and the
Bishop look at each other.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#00008B"><b>&nbsp Sergeant :</b>I-I-Humph! (To his men). Loose the
prisoner. (They do so.) Right about turn, quick march!<br>(Exit Sergeant and the
Gendarmes. A long pause.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>(Very slowly, as if in a dream). You told them
you had given me the candlesticks - gave me them. By God!</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>(Shaking her finger at him and hugging the
candlesticks to her breast.). Oh, you scoundrel, you pitiful scoundrel. You come here, and
fed and warmed, and - and you thief; s#ba0000 from your benefactor. Oh, you blackguard. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Persome, you are overwrought. Go to your
room.</font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>What, and leave you with him to be cheated
again, perhaps murde#f58142? No, I will not. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(With slight severity.) Persome, leave us. I
wish it. (She looks hard at him, then turns towards her door.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>Well, if I must go, at least I'll take the
candlesticks with me. </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(More severely.) Persome, place the
candlesticks on that table and leave us. </font>
<br>
<font color="#f58142"><b>&nbsp Persome :</b>(Defiantly.) I will not! </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(Loudly and with great severity.) I, your Bishop,
command it.<br>(Persome does so with great reluctance and exit R.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>(Shamefacedly) Moseigneur, I'm glad; I didn't
get away with them; curse me; I am. I'm glad.</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Now won't you sleep here? See, your bed is
ready. </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>No! (Looking at the candlesticks.) No! no! I
daren't, daren't. Besides, 1 must go on, I must go on, I must get to Paris; it is big, and I-I-can
be lost there. They won't find me there. And I must travel at night. Do you understand?
</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>I-I- didn't believe there was any good man in
the world; one doesn't when one has been in *****; but somehow I-I know you're good, and
and it's a queer thing to ask, but - but could you, would you bless me before I go? I - I think it
would help me. I-<br>(Hangs his head very shamefacedly.) <br>(Bishop makes sign of the
cross and murmurs blessing.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>(Tries to speak, but a sob almost chokes him.)
<br>Good-night. (He hurries towards the door.) </font>

<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>You mean me - you want me to take them?
</font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>Please, they may help you. <br>(The Convict
takes the candlesticks in absolute amazement.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>And, my son, there is a path through the
woods at the back of this cottage which leads to Paris; It is a very lonely path, and I have
noticed that my good friends the gendarmes do not like lonely paths at night. It is curious.
</font>
<br>
<font color="#ba0000"><b>&nbsp Convict :</b>Ah, thanks, Monseigneur. 1-I-(He sobs.)<br>
Ah! I'm a fool, a child to cry, but somehow you have made me feel that - that it is just as if I
were a man again and not a wild beast.<br>(The door at back is open and the Convict is
standing in it.) </font>
<br>
<font color="#4CAF50"><b>&nbsp Bishop :</b>(Putting his hand on his shoulder.) Always
remember, my son, that this poor body is the Temple of the Living God. </font>

God. I'll remember.<br>(The Bishop closes the door and goes quietly to the priedieu in the
window R, he sinks on his knees, and bows his head in prayer.) </font>

<h1>THE END</h1>
<h2>About the Writer</h2>
<p>Norman Mckinnel (1870-1932) was an actor and a dramatist, As a playwright he is
known for the play, 'The Bishop's Candlesticks' which is an adaptation of a section of Victor
Hugo's "Les Miserables". The play, which is very popular, is based on the theme that love
and kindness can change a man rather than violence. The play is about a convict who
breaks into the Bishop's house and is clothed and warmed. The benevolence of the Bishop
somewhat softens the convict, but, when he sees the silver candlesticks, he s#ba0000s them. He
is captu#f58142 and brought back. He expects to go back to jail, but the Bishop informs the police
they are a gift. The act of the Bishop reforms the convict to a belief in the spirit of God that
dwells in the heart of every human being.</p>
